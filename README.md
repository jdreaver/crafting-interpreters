# Crafting Interpreters

My code for the book [Crafting
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com). I've already written
a [compiler for a functional programming
language](https://github.com/jdreaver/amy) using Haskell and LLVM many
years ago, so a lot of this is review, but I thought this would be a
fun book to read and a good place to practice Rust.
